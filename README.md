## Open source! (YAY)
This software is free of charge for personal use and fully open source, but does have licensing restrictions.

## Releases
Download the latest version from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

## License (Lame)
For Licensing information, please refer to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for more details on redistribution and forking.

TLDR: Don't try to profit from the work I did that I intentionally chose to be free and open source

## Terms and Conditions (Boring)
For Terms and Conditions, please refer to [TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md](TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md) for (quite frankly) some generic information
that absolves me of any responsibilities because you are using this (free and open source) tool yourself.

TLDR1: You're using this software, not me. I'm not responsible if you share the output.
TLDR2: You're responsible for your own data backups. This is running on your PC, not mine. This is free. Backup your own data!
