Instead of "No orders yet" Let's add a persistent helpful message while there are no orders. Along the lines of "When you add cards to an order, they will no longer be in your collection. If you remove cards from an order, they will be back in your collection." etc

Add a new tab after collection called "Listings". This will behave very similarly to orders. But here these entities are more so 'ephemeral'. In other words, adding cards to these listings does not move them from your collection and these are just to help the user organize a social media post. so we need a table for listings and a listing will contain title and list of cards (or ids?). We will need a simple create listing dialog for this that will just take in title and a message along the lines of "you will add cards after you create the listing". These will be displayed in a list similar to order cards - we display a title and overflow menu where overflow menu has "add cards" and uses the same add cards dialog as order card. When cards are added to a listing, we will format them into markdown body text where each card gets a bulletted line with card name asking price and hyperlinks to sportscardpro and ebay. We will have a material copy icon next to the title to copy title to clipboard and a material copy icon next to the markdown body to copy that to clipboard. We will also have a reddit logo icon button to the left of the overflow menu that will link out to https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/submit/?type=TEXT with title and body automatically filled out if possible.
