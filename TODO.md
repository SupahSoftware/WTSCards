1. In the settings page, we have a save button to trigger settings updates. Let's keep the save button, but lets ALSO just make sure changing a toggle switch value does a write immediately. Users should not have to toggle on and then click save.
2. Update order dialog. When name is not filled out, outline stroke will be red. On text change we should remove the outline if there is any text in there. On text change if empty show outline. For street address, city, state, zip, we will do the same thing but outline in yellow (Because they are optional). For pounds and ounces we will outline both in yellow if both are 0 and remove the outline if either one of them is > 0
3. In the shipping section of settings, add an input field to the start of each row of inputs for default cost. Envelope defaults to $1.00, bubble mailer defaults to $7.00, box defaults to $10.00
