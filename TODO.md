1. the input widths on the settings page is wrong. the first input in the multi-input rows is taking up the whole width of the row
2. Clicking 'Add cards' on the overflow menu opens the add card dialog. We should auto focus the input field so you can start typing immediately without clicking in
3. For some reason the 'add card screen' clicks arean't working. I can't click on anything on the screen at all. I can't click to select an input or click the button. I can however tab select to an input and start typing tab to select the button then enter to trigger the click
